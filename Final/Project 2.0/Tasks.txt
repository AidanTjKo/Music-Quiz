Task 1
Design and code the main page front end
(Include the initial design)
Issues I ran into:
- Depending on the screen size some of the elements would be skewed because I used px so I converted it to the screens %
- Lots of adjusting



Task 2
Design and code the game page front end 
-	I wanted to add a visual representation of the lives instead of just a number so I added the hearts.
-	I wanted a cooler answer bar so I used code from a input bar tutorial I followed before
-	I wanted a cool submit button as well so I used code from another button tutorial I followed before
-	I wanted a cool colour scheme so I made a system where you could use variables for colours
Errors:
Initially I thought that you were suppose to guess the song and the artist so I made two answer bars.

Task 3
Find the optimal way to store and access the music data
Errors:
At the start, I tried to add a json file in the file manager folder and trying to read
I used xml reading 

Task 4 
Finding a way to link the two pages 

Task 5
Start to create the actual game
-Underscore were conjoined so you couldnâ€™t count the individual characters
-Changed the font

Task 6
Creating transitions for guessing the song right

Task 7
Creating the game over page when the player loses all of their lives

Task 8 
Finishing touches
